    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>I’ve made some of my projects open sourced on gitHub, and I invite you to check them out. Open source is more
        than just sharing
        code. It’s about collaborating with others, learning from each other, and creating something that benefits
        everyone.
        <br><br>
        In these projects, you’ll find countless hours of work, dedication, and learning. Each line of code tells a
        story of a problem faced, a challenge overcome, and a solution found. They are a testament to my journey as a
        coder, and I am proud to share them with the world.
        <br><br>
        But these projects are not just for viewing. They are for learning, for collaborating, and for improving. So, I
        encourage you to dive in. Explore the code, play around with it, learn from it. If you find something that can
        be
        improved, don’t hesitate to make a change. That’s the beauty of open source - it’s a community effort.
        <br><br>
        So please, check out my open-source projects. Learn from them, contribute to them, and help make them better.
    </p>
