    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I am <b>Mohammed Zaid The Great</b>, and by great I mean the greatest in Coding, there are many programming
        languages
        which I have learnt from my tutor Ms.Nikita who has taught me many things including Error Detection, how to use
        the correct syntax, extensions of JavaScript including p5.js, ml5.js, etc.
        there are many things I know.
        <br><br>
        Not only have I mastered the art of coding, but I have also delved into the intricacies of data structures and
        algorithms, enhancing my problem-solving skills. My journey didn’t stop there. I ventured into the realm of web
        development, learning frameworks like HTML and CSS, which allowed me to create dynamic and interactive
        websites.
        <br><br>
        My thirst for knowledge led me to explore the field of machine learning. I learnt libraries like DoodleNet and
        MobileNet, etc, and used them to build models that can predict, classify and understand complex patterns.
        <br><br>
        I have also dabbled in mobile application development, using tools like MIT APP DEVELOPER. This has
        enabled me to create applications that are both functional and user-friendly.
        <br><br>
        But my learning does not stop here. Every day is a new opportunity to learn and grow. And with each passing day,
        I strive to become a better version of myself. Coding is not just a skill for me, it’s a passion. It’s a way for
        me to express my creativity and solve real-world problems.
        <br><br>
        I am grateful to my tutor, Ms.Nikita, for igniting this passion within me and for guiding me on this exciting
        journey of coding.
    </p>
